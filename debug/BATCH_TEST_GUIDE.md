## üé≠ Quality Checklist

Listen for:
- ‚úì Natural pauses at `...`
- ‚úì Whispered voice at `[whispers]`

- ‚úì Exhaling sound at `[exhales]`
- ‚úì Monotone, calm delivery overall
- ‚úì Subtle emotional variation in tags

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **API Quota**: Each file costs credits - be mindful
2. **Rate Limiting**: Don't process too fast
3. **File Size**: Longer texts = larger files
4. **Quality**: Use `mp3_44100_128` for best quality

## üöÄ Recommended Workflow

```bash
# 1. Test one file first
python debug/elevenlabs_tts_standalone.py debug/voice_text/01_greeting.txt

# 2. Listen to verify quality
# (play the generated .mp3)

# 3. If good, process all
python debug/elevenlabs_tts_standalone.py debug/voice_text

# 4. Review all generated audio files
```

## üìà Success Metrics

- All 20 files generate audio ‚úÖ
- Natural pauses sound natural ‚úÖ
- [whispers] creates soft voice ‚úÖ
- [sighs] creates sighing sound ‚úÖ
