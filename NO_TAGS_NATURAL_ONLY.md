```

## 🎭 Character Prompt Updated

**`prompts/character.txt`** now states:

```
Natural Pause Usage (for TTS):
- Use "..." for pauses, silence, and hesitation
- Pauses convey emotion: distance, confusion, contemplation
- Keep it natural - pauses should feel organic

Important: Only use natural ellipsis (...). 
Do NOT use special tags like [whispers], [sighs], etc. 
as they are not supported.
```

## 📁 Updated Test Files

## 🧪 Verification

### Format Test
```bash
python -c "
from src.utils.text_formatting import format_for_elevenlabs
text = '[sighs] ...Hello [whispers] there'
result = format_for_elevenlabs(text)
print(f'Input:  {text}')
print(f'Output: {result}')
print(f'Status: {\"✅ Clean\" if \"[\" not in result else \"❌ Has tags\"}')
"
```

Output:
```
Input:  [sighs] ...Hello [whispers] there
Output: ...Hello there
Status: ✅ Clean
```

    # Test with text that would have had tags
    text = '...Hello. I... thank you.'
    audio = await tts.text_to_speech(text)
    print('✅ Main workflow: Works with natural pauses only!')

asyncio.run(test())
"
```
