# LangGraph Architecture in Hoorii Smart Home AI Assistant

## Overview

The Hoorii Smart Home AI Assistant implements a **dual-workflow architecture** where LangGraph serves as the modern, state-managed orchestration framework alongside a traditional sequential workflow. LangGraph provides better observability, state persistence, and workflow visualization capabilities.

## System Architecture Choice

The system dynamically chooses between two workflow implementations:

1. **LangGraph Workflow** (Preferred): Modern state graph-based orchestration
2. **Traditional Workflow** (Fallback): Sequential processing pipeline

```python
# From src/main.py
system = await create_ai_system(config, use_langgraph=True)
```

The system checks for LangGraph availability and falls back to traditional workflow if not available.

## LangGraph Implementation Details

### Core Components

#### 1. State Definition (`AISystemState`)
```python
class AISystemState(TypedDict):
    user_input: str
    user_id: Optional[str]
    session_id: Optional[str]
    context: Optional[Dict]
    intent_analysis: Optional[Dict]
    device_actions: Optional[List[Dict]]
    character_response: Optional[str]
    final_response: Optional[str]
    error: Optional[str]
    metadata: Optional[Dict]
```

#### 2. Workflow Modes

**Fast Mode (Default):**
- Single LLM call combining intent analysis and response generation
- Uses `FastProcessor` for speed optimization
- Reduces latency and API costs

**Original Mode:**
- Separate LLM calls for each step
- More detailed processing but higher latency
- Better for complex scenarios requiring detailed analysis

### Node Architecture

#### Fast Mode Nodes:
1. **`fast_process`**: Single LLM call for intent + response
2. **`execute_device_actions`**: Device control execution
3. **`finalize_response`**: Response formatting and context updates
4. **`handle_error`**: Error handling and recovery

#### Original Mode Nodes:
1. **`analyze_intent`**: Intent analysis using `IntentAnalyzer`
2. **`execute_device_actions`**: Device control execution
3. **`generate_character_response`**: Character response using `CharacterSystem`
4. **`finalize_response`**: Response formatting and context updates
5. **`handle_error`**: Error handling and recovery

### State Flow Management

#### Conditional Routing
```python
def _should_execute_devices(self, state: AISystemState) -> str:
    """Determines next node based on intent analysis"""
    if state.get("error"):
        return "error"
    
    intent_analysis = state.get("intent_analysis", {})
    actions = intent_analysis.get("actions", [])
    
    has_device_actions = any(
        action.get("type") == "device_control"
        for action in actions
    )
    
    return "execute" if has_device_actions else "skip"
```

#### Memory Management
- Uses `MemorySaver` for state persistence across conversations
- Thread-based session management with `thread_id`
- Context preservation between interactions

### Integration with Core Components

#### Component Orchestration
```python
# Initialize services
self.db_service = DatabaseService(self.config)
self.context_manager = ContextManager()
self.intent_analyzer = IntentAnalyzer(self.config)
self.device_controller = DeviceController(self.config)
self.character_system = CharacterSystem(self.config)
self.fast_processor = FastProcessor(self.config)
```

Each node wraps existing core components while adding state management and observability.

### Observability Integration

#### Langfuse Tracing
- Each node decorated with `@observe()` for detailed tracing
- Automatic trace creation and session management
- Performance metrics and error tracking
- User interaction analytics

```python
@observe(name="fast_process_node")
async def _fast_process_node(self, state: AISystemState) -> AISystemState:
    # Node implementation with automatic tracing
```

#### Session Management
- Thread-based session persistence
- State checkpointing for conversation continuity
- Metadata tracking for analytics

## Workflow Execution Flow

### Fast Mode Flow:
```
User Input → fast_process → [Device Actions?] → execute_device_actions → finalize_response → Response
                         → [No Device Actions] → finalize_response → Response
```

### Original Mode Flow:
```
User Input → analyze_intent → [Device Actions?] → execute_device_actions → generate_character_response → finalize_response → Response
                           → [No Device Actions] → generate_character_response → finalize_response → Response
```

### Error Handling:
```
Any Node → [Error Occurs] → handle_error → Error Response
```

## Configuration and Setup

### Dependencies
```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, START, END
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
```

### Initialization
```python
# Create workflow
workflow = StateGraph(AISystemState)

# Add nodes
workflow.add_node("fast_process", self._fast_process_node)
workflow.add_node("execute_device_actions", self._execute_device_actions_node)

# Define edges and conditional routing
workflow.add_conditional_edges(
    "fast_process",
    self._should_execute_devices,
    {"execute": "execute_device_actions", "skip": "finalize_response"}
)

# Compile with memory
self.workflow = workflow.compile(checkpointer=self.memory)
```

## Comparison: LangGraph vs Traditional Workflow

| Feature | LangGraph Workflow | Traditional Workflow |
|---------|-------------------|---------------------|
| State Management | Built-in state graph | Manual context passing |
| Observability | Automatic tracing | Manual logging |
| Error Handling | Node-level recovery | Try-catch blocks |
| Workflow Visualization | Graph representation | Linear sequence |
| Session Persistence | Thread-based checkpointing | Manual save/load |
| Scalability | Horizontal scaling ready | Single-threaded |
| Debugging | Visual workflow debugging | Log-based debugging |

## Usage Example

```python
# Initialize LangGraph system
system = LangGraphHomeAISystem(config)

# Process message
response = await system.process_message(
    user_input="Turn on the living room lights",
    user_id="user123",
    session_id="session456"
)

# Get workflow state
state = await system.get_workflow_state("session456")
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-Agent Workflows**: Support for specialized agents
2. **Parallel Processing**: Concurrent node execution
3. **Advanced Routing**: ML-based workflow routing
4. **Real-time Streaming**: Streaming responses during processing
5. **Workflow Templates**: Reusable workflow patterns

## Conclusion
